Self-Reflection of My Time at 42 Silicon Valley

V1. Motivation

Why did you join 42?
I joined 42 to find opportunities, network, and learn computer science. Although
I had graduated from Howard University, a place with a lot of opportunities in
computer science, I did not meet many people interested in health-tech, let alone
anyone who had a more nontraditional path. 42 is the hub of nontraditional galore.
It is honestly comforting to find more people like you -- who have worked in a 
different industry or who decided to pursue this nontraditional coding school
instead of a university. These people are the people that will create the next
world -- they are people that think outside the box and have motivation to learn
not because someone is forcing them but because they truly love learning.

What am I looking for here? 
Guidance. I am looking for guidance in the field that
I may want to do and to learn more about tech in general. I am unaware of so many
tech words/jargon, and I honestly do feel lost in a conversation about tech. This
type of environment -- one with an endless away of tech enthusiasts -- will help me
develop that tech termninology.

What is your purpose?
My purpose is to develop a health-tech presence online and to gain some basic skills
needed to well, not flail, in the tech world. Although I have yet to breach the 
health-tech world, I am meeting up with a few people in Silicon Valley, so I am
slowly expanding my connections, and, hopefully, will one day be able to find that
person who knows exactly what part of health-tech I am interested in.

Is 42 the right school for you?
I'm not sure. It is not perfect, to be honest. There is definitely a lot of failing.
However, this school does teach you a lot of life lessons and prepares you for the 
real world. The education -- I do believe that there should be some morning classes
or such pertaining to each project so we could better learn the theory. However, I
do enjoy my time here and the friends that I have made.

Are you compatible with its peer-learning method?
I honestly do think I am. I am quite social when I want to be. The weakness though
is that I am sometimes overly nice. At one point, I just got annoyed at everyone
and wanted to hide in a little corner and not help anyone because I was unable to get
anything done because people kept on asking me for help. It's good to learn a 
balance between saying yes and no. If you're busy or not free, then be honest. You
don't need to help everyone.

Do you enjoy challenges, discovering things on your own, being autonomous?
Yes, yes, yes! However, if I am utterly lost, I would definitely love some guidance.
To be honest, I am still searching for a mentor in computer science -- someone who
is willing to help me figure out my pathway of merging medicine and tech.

Do you like studying at 42 or just the idea of it?
I do love studying at 42 -- not just the idea of it. I wasn't fond of the traditional
eduation system, so here I am.

V2. Attendance Time at 42

Do you think you work hard enough? Why, or why not? 
To be honest, although I do love coding, I am not working hard enough because of my 
other duties and goals for being at 42. I am interested in learning about computer 
science but it is a little hard to determine what part of computer science I want to
do since I am unaware of what is a good pathway to merge healthcare and CS. Freddy
Abnousi, the head of Facebook's healthcare team, is one of the leading examples
who is able to bridge the gap between medicine and healthcare. Yes, we can be a physician,
but how many lives are we saving? There is only so many physicians. You can have a broader
impact of taking your experience in the field and help create technology or become the
liason between the two fields. America is pretty good at taking care of ill patients
compared to other countries but there is a discrepancy in preventing the illness onset.
Preventative measures are just as important to explore. My apologies for going on a 
tangetnt, but I am not working hard enough. My pathway toward what I want to do is not
easy by far, so I need to work even harder.

Can you do better? How?
Yes, I should be able to create a stronger online portfolio and do projects more 
efficienctly. Kmira, another 42 student, although he had little-no background in CS, 
his code is probably one of the cleanest and most efficient codes compared to other
students at 42 Silicon Valley. There are people at admire at 42 -- he is one of them.

V3. Output

How do you split your time spent at 42?
I probably spend a total of about 1 week actually coding a month. The other time is 
dedicated toward helping others, doing vounteer/ambassador events, going to different
meetings, and working on my professional presence/applying to job opportunities.

Where do you spend most of your time here? Why?
I spend the most of my time here either at my boyfriend's house or in Zone 3. I always
sit in the same desk but my hours are a little erratic. There is more to life than
just studying. My relationship with those who I care about is also important. As a result,
I choose to allocate my time differently than most students, but I do admit that I 
should focus on computer science more.

Do you spend more time on your IDE or on your browser? Why?
I spend more time on the browser than IDE, which is unfortunate. I should be spending 
more time on the terminal or visual studio code, figuring out the code. The reason
that I spend a lot of time online is because there are multiple distractions I have
and tasks that I am doing that I must constantly work. 

How could you improve your productivity?
I could improve my productivity by telling my friends to message me if they have a 
question rather than coming up to me and tapping my shoulder or asking for help. 
(Side note: I would love to help everyone, but I can't unfortuantely). In addition, I
bought sound-decreasing headphones to help alleviate the noise, and, with these bulky 
headphones, hopefully, others will consider messaging before tapping my shoulder
to get my attention.

What do you think about the phrases "practice makes perfect" and "one doesn't learn how to
ride a bike by watching someone else riding it?"
Practice does not quite make perfect but practice can significantly improve one's skills.
It is true that you need to actually code to improve your coding skills. That is why
I like the hands-on coding here rather than just theoretical knowledge.

V4. Peer-Pedagogy

Do you perceive peer-evaluations as a constraint, or even a waste of time?
At 42, I consider it a benefit because I get to preview projects that I may not have
worked on but other cadets have. In addition, I could learn how to better implement
my code or to defend why I chose a particular method for my code.

Is the code you hand in truly yours? Are you capable of rewriting your own projects
from scratch? Do you fully understand them?
The code in my hand is mine, but, to be honest, I don't know if I could rewrite 
the project from scratch. I probably could but it woudl take time and I would have
to Google also. The reason I am saying this is that I often forget or can't read 
my own code. I am not good at remembering why I chose to implement a certain statement
or what I am doing even though I coded it. As a result, one of the weaknesses I have
is reading code.

Have you ever cheated? Why?
Have I ever cheated? Yes, and no. Is looking at other people's GitHub considered 
cheating, or is it considered learning how to read other people's code and look
at how to better implement something?

When you're struggling, what do you do? Does it work?
When I'm struggling, I ask for help. I try to ask my friends first but if I can't figure
it out, I will reach out for help in the group chats. Some people answer -- others don't.
I have tried attending Socrates club before but I honestly was terrified as well because
the students' knowledge of CS is immense. 

When someone is struggling nearby, what do you do? Why? 
I help them, of course. If I'm struggling, I would love to soemone to provide me a 
hint toward the correct direction. I treat others as how I want to be treated.

V5. Goals

Short-Term Goal: To finish ft_printf!

Mid-Term Goal: To gain an internship in CS that is health-tech related.

Long-Term Goal: To work at the top company's healthcare division (eg. Google Health/Verily)

V6. Personal Situation

Do you know about the procedures, services, and key contact-persons that could help you?
Nope. It would be interesting to have these resources clearly available to the students.
I do know who to contact if I were in a crisis -- Crisis Textline! It's a free texting 
services to help people get out of the crisis.

V7. Your Conclusions

What are the actions that you can now undertake to improve your situation?
To determine what I want to do. I have been trying to no avail. So, instead of trying to
swim in an ocean and reach the other side, instead I will build upon the skills that I 
believe would be useful as a future health-tech leader.

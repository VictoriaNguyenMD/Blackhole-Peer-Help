# Blackhole-Peer-Help

![ReadMe Snippet](https://i.ibb.co/X48mFf7/Screen-Shot-2020-01-18-at-4-14-51-PM.png)

### Objective:
To understand what led to delays in 42 leveling and to draw the necessary conclusions.

### Note To You:

Technically, you do not need to write anything down but rather just discuss your situation with another peer. This is a time to seek help if you need it. I had chosen to briefly write down some of my responses because I don't always say what I truly believe in to a peer due to either shyness, uncomfortableness, or irrelevance. The `response.txt` is a stream of thought and my first answer to each question. Of course, there could be other reasons, and I could have expanded upon the answers, but, due to my time limitations, I condensed everything to a brief response.
